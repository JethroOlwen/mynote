DISTINCT : to show list of available values
===================================================
between for text case
	When the values are text, BETWEEN filters the result set for within the alphabetical range.

In this statement, BETWEEN filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with the letter ‘A’ up to, but not including ones that begin with ‘J’.

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
However, if a movie has a name of simply ‘J’, it would actually match. This is because BETWEEN goes up to the second value — up to ‘J’. So the movie named ‘J’ would be included in the result set but not ‘Jaws’.


AND can be use for between and combining multiple condition




Order by : to sort the data 
	order by name desc => z -> a, asc => a->z
	you can also sort the data in field A but order it by field B


/* 
This will order on the year, then order the 
names in reverse alphabetical 
order, preserving the order
of the year column.
*/

SELECT year, name
FROM movies
ORDER BY year ASC, name DESC;
